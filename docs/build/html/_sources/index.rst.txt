MEDfl is a modular and extensible Python framework designed to accelerate
research and deployment in Federated Learning (FL), particularly in the medical
domain.

MEDfl supports **two complementary modes**:

- **Simulation Mode** — a controlled environment with virtual clients that allows
  researchers to rapidly experiment, test assumptions, and validate hypotheses
  before moving to real-world deployment.

- **Real-World Mode** — a production-ready execution layer where FL pipelines
  run on distributed machines using the MEDfl Agent, Flower, and secure
  networking. This mode enables seamless deployment across hospitals,
  institutions, and research teams.

Together, these two modes provide a complete workflow:  
from **idea → experiment → validation → real-world deployment**.

For users seeking an even more accessible experience, MEDfl is fully
integrated into **MEDfl application**, a user-friendly desktop application that
simplifies the creation and orchestration of FL pipelines. MEDomicsLab bridges
the gap between medical researchers and computer scientists, promoting
collaboration through intuitive tools, automated workflows, and secure
distributed execution.

Simulation Mode
===============

MEDfl's **simulation mode** enables you to design, analyze, and validate FL
pipelines using virtual clients running locally. This environment is ideal for:

- testing hypotheses  
- benchmarking FL configurations  
- evaluating differential privacy and transfer learning  
- exploring architectural variations  
- iterating rapidly and safely before real-world deployment

Real-World Mode
===============

MEDfl's **real-world mode** enables deploying FL pipelines across distributed
machines such as hospital servers, institutional workstations, or research
nodes. This mode integrates:

- the MEDfl Python Agent  
- Flower federated learning protocol  
- secure peer-to-peer networking via Tailscale  
- environment validation and client orchestration  
- robust, production-ready execution  

It provides a seamless path from validated simulation to real, distributed
collaboration in medical research.
