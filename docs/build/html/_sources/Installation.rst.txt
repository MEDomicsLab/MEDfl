Installation
============

Python Requirements
-------------------
The MEDfl package requires **Python 3.9+**.  
If you do not have Python installed on your machine, you can download it from:  
`Python <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_

MEDfl uses **SQLite** as its default database engine.  
SQLite requires **no setup and no configuration** — it works automatically using a local `.db` file generated by MEDfl.

Package Installation (For Users)
--------------------------------

If you simply want to **use MEDfl**, you can install the package directly from PyPI:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install MEDfl

This installs the latest stable release and allows you to start using MEDfl immediately.

Package Installation (For Contributors)
---------------------------------------

If you want to **collaborate**, contribute, or modify the MEDfl source code, install it from GitHub in editable mode:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/MEDomics-UdeS/MEDfl.git
   cd MEDfl
   pip install -e .

This setup allows you to modify the package locally while testing new features.

Database Configuration
----------------------

No database configuration is required.

MEDfl uses **SQLite**, a lightweight and reliable file-based database system.  
A local `.db` file is created automatically when you initialize the MEDfl environment or use any functionality requiring storage.  
No external server, setup script, or credentials are needed.
